### Hi there 👋 I'm Gracie Diabo (she/her)

I'm a **Software Engineering Co-op Student** at McGill University!

I'm passionate about using technology to empower underrepresented communities and believe that software has the power to create meaningful and inclusive solutions that make a difference. 

I’m committed to learning and staying curious. I don't just want to know the what. I want to learn why and how? Why this way and not another? How is this different and how can it be improved? 

Collaboration is at my core, and I thrive when I can work alongside others to turn  ideas into impactful projects. My journey reflects my dedication to growth, adaptability, and creating tools that uplift and inspire.

## 🌟 About Me
- 🎓 I’m a third-year (U3) student at McGill in Montreal, QC, Canada.
- ✨ I'm fascinated by Indigenous languages, AI/data ethics, urban planning & its history.
- 💗 Outside of software, I'm also the Co-President of [POWE](https://powe.mcgilleus.ca/), McGill's Women in Engineering Club, and a National Student Rep for [AISES](https://aises.org/student-representatives/)!
-  🇨🇦 I speak native English and intermediate French (along with beginner Mohawk & Spanish!)
- ⚡ In my free time, I enjoy pilates, running, and weight lifting.
  
I’d love to connect and chat about projects, ideas, and new technologies!
