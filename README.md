### Hi there 👋 I'm Gracie Diabo (she/her)

I'm a **Software Engineering Co-op Student** at McGill University!

I'm passionate about using technology to empower underrepresented communities and believe that software has the power to create meaningful and inclusive solutions that make a difference. 

I’m committed to learning and staying curious. I don't just want to know the what. I want to learn why and how? Why this way and not another? How is this different and how can it be improved? 

Collaboration is at my core, and I thrive when I can work alongside others to turn  ideas into impactful projects. My journey reflects my dedication to growth, adaptability, and creating tools that uplift and inspire.
